<h4>
    If you have read about my education before, I have said that I am a student of UiTM Rembau Campus who took a Diploma in Information Management. When I first found out that I got from Rembau, I was quite happy because I could feel the experience of studying away from home. The reason I feel happy is that I want to experience the feeling of being away from family and I want to try to be independent in my daily life. I indeed used to sit in dormitories, but my family would visit me on the weekends and this meant that every week I would meet them. I prefer to study away from my family because it will make me appreciate, miss, and not forget those who are far from sight. So when I’m together with family, I will be more appreciative of the time spent together and always appreciate them as long as I’m not away from them.
</h4>
<h4>^^</h4>
<h4>
    In the beginning, I set foot in Rembau, my feelings were mixed with feelings of sadness, joy, fear, and more. Throughout the registration, I thought of various things like what I would do after this, would I be okay here, hope that everything would go smoothly, and so on. After completing the registration and tidying up the room, I and the other students were instructed to gather and the orientation session began. Normally, the orientation will run even at night, however, we did not because he said he wanted us, new students, to rest because there will be various activities and briefings that will be conducted throughout the orientation.
</h4>
<h4>^^</h4>
<h4>
    After the orientation session, we started the class and I was very excited because I was going to start getting to know my classmates and at first I was very scared of how I would behave. Still, they are very sporting and I am happy to get to know them. In addition, I also got to know many people from other classes, other courses, and also various fields such as I got to know senior commanders, with students from other faculties and I was also able to improve my communication by talking and chatting with them.
</h4>
<h4>^^</h4>
<h4>
    However, I could not create many more memories just because the MCO was conducted and this is what resulted in most students starting to learn from home, and I as a student understand the situation of other students out there. I’m not sure if other students feel the same way or not but as far as I know, face-to-face classes are easier than these online classes. On this occasion, I would like to tell you all that every difficulty or challenge we face, there must be wisdom and lessons that we can take and learn and make a guide for life. I know it is not easy for us to rise from the fall yet, know all of you that God will test His servant whom He loves and God will not test His servant if His servant is not capable. So, always smile and face the difficulties or challenges calmly and rationally because every problem has a solution but it is not necessarily fast or slow.

<br>

<h4>
    Next up was my experience as an MCO where I knew everyone had their own story. Huh, do you want to know what I did during the MCO? That's why I want this story, let's go!!

<h4>
    When our prime minister announced that the MCO would be held, my feelings at the time were very scared because I was still in college due to class demands face to face and at the same time, my parents had started calling me asking if I would go home that day or the next day. I decided to go home as my house is not that far from Rembau which only takes about an hour.
</h4>
<h4>^^</h3>
<h4>
    When I got home, my family started talking and talking about what was really going on in this country, asking about my college life, and so on. Since I am a person who can sit at home because I am a person who prefers to sit at home rather than go out and at that time, MCO was said to be only 2 weeks or a month like that, so I think it's okay that it's only a month without going out. That time I was still able to survive, but as time went on the MCO time increased and it became two to three months and I started to feel bored and the feeling of wanting to go out for a walk was very exaggerated.
</h4>
<h4>^^</h4>
<h4>
    All that I can curb with the activities I do at home such as watching Kdrama, movies, and packing. Students of that time are required to resume studying but online which is called online distance learning (ODL) in month 4. Therefore, our time as students is not so empty because our daily routine is filled with classes and assignments given. But what I want to say here is, my daily routine is to study, go to online classes, cook, watch Kdrama and movies and clean the house only. That is our daily routine as a family and sometimes it feels lazy to get up to repeat that routine.

    I think this is all the story of my experience during the MCO because that’s all I did when the MCO was run. In closing, I would like to urge you all to always be careful no matter where you are. Stay safe, stay healthy, don't forget to wear a mask, and most importantly always smile okay! :>
