<h4>I'm Iffah Batrisyia, better known as Iffah. I am a 21-year-old student from Johor Baharu. However, I currently live in Melaka and study in Rembau, Negeri Sembilan, which is UiTM Negeri Sembilan Branch, Rembau Campus. Here, I took a Diploma in Information Management and this year was my last year undergoing it.</h4>

<h4>The name of my website came from my korean name. It is because of my hobby which is learning different types of language, singing, dancing, and watching Kdramas and movies if I have free time. In this way too, I can increase my knowledge of the language as I like learning multiple languages.</h4>
<h4>^^</h4>
<h4>I just wanted to start my little website with my daily routine stories and trips. I hope you all enjoy my blog and will invite more of your contacts to visit my blog. Please do not hesitate and be afraid to contact me if you have any questions, discuss collaborations, or even want to chat with me. You are all very welcome to contact me no matter anytime.</h4>

<h4>*Iffah_xoxo*</h4>
